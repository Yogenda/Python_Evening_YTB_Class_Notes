python vs java

execution flow
- source code
- compiler
- bytecode
- PVM - interpreter
- Machine code

Variables: reserved memory location or named memory location.
age=25 # int value
name="yogendra" #string
score=95.5 #float

naming rules
- must start with letter or an underscore(_)
- can not start with number
	user1 - valid
	1user - invalid
- alphabet, number, and underscore
	total_amount - valid
	total-amount - not valid 
- case sensitive
	myvalue, MyValue, MYVALUE, Myvalue
- No reserved keywords

value kw - true, false, none
logical op- and, or, not
control flow - if, else, elif, for, while, break, continue
function & class - def, return, class, lambda
exception - try, except, finally, raise, assert
imports - import, from , as
scope - with, global, nonlocal
asynchronous - async, await

naming convention
	- snake case (user_reg_data)
	- camel case (MyCodingClass or myCodingClass)
	- avoid using single name use descriptive name

import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist)

int - whole numbers
float - real numbers with decimal (10.5, 0.02, 2.5e2)
	10^2= 250.0
string - seq of characters ('', "", ''',""")
Boolean - True, False

============ class 2 ====================

type() = to check the type of variable
isinstance() = it handles inheritance

type casting: is known as type conversion - process of changing a variable from one data type to another.
- implicit - python convert the type automatically.
- explicit - manually converting the type.

Note: when i am using input() it always returns the string type.

why is type casting important?
- preventing errors
- data precision
- user interaction

Memory basics()

operators: special symbols used to perform operations on variables and value.

a+b
a,b = operands
+ = operator

- arithmetic operators (mathematical calculations)
	+ (add) -(subtract) *(Multi) /(division) //(Floor Division) %(Modulus) **(Power)
used to :- calculations, finance app, counters, scores, marks

/ division: decimal
// Floor Division : questiont
% Modulus: 

comparison operator:
==		equal to 	
!= 		not equal
>		Greater than
<		less than
>= 		greater than or equal
<=		less than or equal

5==5
5>5
5>=5

use case: Login systems, age verification, conditions in if statement


Logical operators: used to combine multiple conditions
and: Both values must be true
a		b 		r
1		0		0
0		1		0
1		1		1
0		0		0
or: at least one value must be true
a		b 		r
1		0		1
0		1		1
1		1		1
0		0		0
not: reverse results
a		r
1		0
0		1

use case: login validation, form validation, access control

Assignment operator: 
a = 5			=
a = a+5 #10		+=
a = a-2 #8		-+
a = a*2 #16		*=
a = a/2 #8		/=
a = a//3 #2		//=
a= a+6 #8		+=
a = a%3 #2		%=

use case: counters, score update, loop increments

Identity operator: check if two variables reffer the same memory location.
	is: Same object
	is not: Different objects

Membership operator: Checks if a value exists in a sequence.
	in: value exists
	not in: value doesnot exist
use case: searching in list, check username in database, validation.

operator precedenc
	- *
	- / // %
	- + -
	- comparison
	- not
	- and
	- or

Advantages of operators
- Make code shorter
- impove readability
- perform fast calculations
- essential for conditions & loops

common mistakes
- using = insted oSf ==
- confusing / and //
- using is insted of ==
- wrong precedence assumption

====== class 5 ========
conditional statement => Control flow statement
If, if-else, elif, 
if: if the statement is true it execute the block of code.
Note: if using the if statement then it must end with ":" and indentation (4 space gap)

elif: if more than 2 conditions or possiblities.

====== class 6 ========
code optimized
- short-circuting
- ternary operator(one-line)
- avoid over nesting
- prefer elif over multiple if's

HW
bank transection security
imagin a system that processes a high value withdrawal.
- it the account active?
- does the account have enough balence?
- if it's a very large amount, does it have an extra security.

====== class 7 ========
loop: execute a block of code multiple times.
NOTE: range(5) it take the values starting from 0 and the last value at is 5 is not printed it takes n-1
for loop: We know how many times we want to run the loop
	syntax
		for variable in sequence:
			#code block
use cases: 
	- processing database records
	- iterating over list, string, tuples......
	- running fixed number of records

pro tip:
use enumerate() when index is needed.

While loop: use dont know how many time we want to run a loop.
syntax
while condition:
	#code run while condion is true

- take user input until valid
- game loop
- wait for a condition to change

always update the condition variable to avoid infinite loops
while num <5:
	print(num)


============ class 9 ===========
Break: it stops the loop immediatly even if condtion is true.
(emergency exit)
use case:
	- stop searching once result is found
	- exit on error
	- early termination for performace

Continue: skips current iteration and moves to the next loop cycle. (skip button)
use case:
	- skip invalid data
	- skip unwanted values

: placeholder that does nothing. (avoid syntax error)

for loop vs while loop
for loop: when number of iteration is known
condition implicit in range/sequence
infinite loop if very low
iterating sequence

while loop: when number of iteration is unknown
explicit condition
risk of infinite loop high if not handled properly
condition based repetition.

============ class 10 =========
nested loops
use case: 
	- matrix operations
	- Pattern printing
	- comparing elements
